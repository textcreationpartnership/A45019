            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Beſides, His Majeſty, if occaſion ſhould be,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45843:4"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 46 -->is veſted with ſufficient power to raiſe forces for the Defence of the Kingdome, for which onely we are confident His Majeſty will employ them. And we ſhould hold our ſelves worſe then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, if, after ſo many Proteſtations to maintain the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by Law establiſhed, the Subjects in the Liberty of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Propriety of their Goods, and the Priviledges of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and that He will Govern us by the known Laws of the Land, we ſhould not with full aſſurance, believe in Him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in Him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> For adjourning the Parliament to another place, His Majeſty hath expreſſed the Reaſons, That He was driven away by tumultuary Aſſemblies, and that he cannot return thither with Honour and Safety: And divers of the Lords are abſent, who promiſe to return back to the Houſe, when they may ſit with the Liberty, and that condition that the Peerage of <hi>England</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done, ſecured from all menaces, or demanding any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their particular Votes; which we conceive to be againſt the Freedome of Parliament, which by our Proteſtation we muſt maintain, and from tumultuarie Aſſemblies: Theſe having been the Occaſions, as we believe, that of near five hundred in the Houſe of Commons, there are but about one hundred and forty left to ſit there, and the greater part of the Lords gone away.</item>

            <p>That after ſo many Injuries and Indignities offered to Him, ſo many combinations and conſpiracies againſt Him, He departed ſo much from His own Majeſtie, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice due to it, That he required no other reparation, then to have His Town, Goods, and Navie (taken and kept by violence from and againſt Him) to be reſtored to Him: The power of making Laws without Him, by the way of Ordinances (and that in particular, concerning the <hi>Militia</hi>) to be diſavowed. And that a ſafe Place might be agreed on, where He might be preſent with His great Councell, for the compoſing of all miſunderſtandings, and making the Kingdome happy.</p>
            <p>That before any Anſwer returned to His Majeſtie (whil'ſt with all patience and hope His Majeſtie forbore any action or attempt of force, according to His promiſe) Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> iſſued out of <hi>Hull</hi> in the Night, burned the Houſes, and murthered the Perſons of his fellow-ſubjects (though he knew His Majeſtie quietly expected an Anſwer to His reaſonable and neceſſary demands) and hath ſince exerciſed moſt barbarous cruelty upon a Drummer then taken priſoner by him.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Propoſitions made by His Majeſtie, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Petitioners in their Inſtructions, are diſſented from, and His Majeſtie not ſuffered to enjoy what is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably His own, as any thing His Subjects can call moſt theirs, upon pretence there is ſome truſt on foot to diſpoſſeſſe His Majeſtie of them: Whether any ſuch truſt be derived from the Petitioners, themſelves beſt know.</p>
            <p>That a Generall is made to command His Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>When the Petitioners and all other His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have weighed this, and conſidered that theſe ſtrange unheard of proceedings muſt be the effects of deſperate Reſolutions, and that all this calamity is brought upon this Nation, to wreſt from his Majeſtie His juſt Rights, when no ſober man can ſee the want of any thing which is in His Majeſties power to grant, and neceſſary for the peace and full happineſſe of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>That when all encouragement is given, ſcandals raiſed, and provocations uſed to incenſe the People againſt His Majeſtie, and to publiſh Petitions and Declarations againſt the known Laws and eſtabliſhed Government: The Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and all other His Majeſties good Subjects (who out of a true ſenſe of the diſtraction and ruine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth muſt ſpeedily fall into through theſe diſtempers have prepared ſober and moderate Petitions and Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions for the peace of the Kingdome) have been diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, cenſured, and impriſoned in a Lawleſſe Arbitrary way, when no offence hath been committed by them, of which the Law hath taken notice: That all their Rights, Intereſts, and Priviledges, which they were born to, by the good known Laws, are taken from them, or ſubjected to an unintelligible Arbitrary power and reſolution, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes their confidence and aſſurance even in Innocency it ſelf; They will think it time to provide for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, by Aſſiſting His Majeſtie for the Defence of His Perſon, preſervation of the true Proteſtant Religion, and maintenance of the Law of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject; of the which, as the Petitioners care is very eminent, and deſerves all protection, thanks, and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Laſtly, leſt any of the Petitioners may unjuſty ſuffer for making or preſenting this humble, dutifull, and modeſt Petition to His Majeſtie; His Majeſtie declares, That He will with His utmoſt power and aſſiſtance protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them againſt any power whatſoever, which ſhall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion them for ſo doing; And to that purpoſe advertiſeth them, That they are not obliged to yield Obedience to any Purſuivants, Sergeants, or Meſſengers, who ſhall endeavour to moleſt them for doing their Duty, and diſcharging their Conſciences therein. And that the whole County of <hi>Kent</hi> may know His Majeſties gracious acceptance of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their Duty and affection unto Him: 'Tis His Majeſties pleaſure, that this Anſwer, together with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Inſtructions, be read in all the Churches and Chappels of that County.</p>
